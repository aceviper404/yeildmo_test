        Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[4] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[5] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc

        Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.[27] It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The docker-compose CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once, for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more.[28] Commands related to image manipulation, or user-interactive options, are not relevant in Docker Compose because they address one container.[29] The docker-compose.yml file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. For example, the build option defines configuration options such as the Dockerfile path, the command option allows one to override default Docker commands, and more.[30] The first public beta version of Docker Compose (version 0.0.1) was released on December 21, 2013.[31] The first production-ready version (1.0) was made available on October 16, 2014.[32]
        Docker Swarm provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine.[33] In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated with Docker Engine.[34] The docker swarm CLI[35] utility allows users to run Swarm containers, create discovery tokens, list nodes in the cluster, and more.[36] The docker node CLI utility allows users to run various commands to manage nodes in a swarm, for example, listing the nodes in a swarm, updating nodes, and removing nodes from the swarm.[37] Docker manages swarms using the Raft consensus algorithm. According to Raft, for an update to be performed, the majority of Swarm nodes need to agree on the update.[38][39]
        Docker Volume facilitates the independent persistence of data, allowing data to remain even after the container is deleted or re-created.[40]
